      <description>Introduction Stoicism is often misunderstood Definition of Stoicism: ancient philosophy that was once one of the most popular civic disciplines in the west Contain some of the greatest wisdom in the history of the world - referring to Meditations by Marcus Aurelius: a series of private notes kept by the Roman Emperor The objective of the book The Daily Stoic is to restore Stoicism to its rightful place as a tool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance and wisdom The philosophy asserts that virtue (the four cardinal virtues of self-control, courage, justice and wisdom) is happiness, and it is our perceptions of things rather than the things themselves that cause most of our trouble It teaches that we can’t control or rely on anything outside of our “reasoned choice” - our ability to choose how we categorise, respond and reorient ourselves to external events Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca framed their work revolving Stoicism around a series of exercises in three critical disciplines: The Discipline of Perception - how we see and perceive the world around us The Discipline of Action - the decisions and actions we take and to what end The Discipline of Will - how we deal with the things we cannot change, attain clear and convincing judgement and come to a true understanding of our place in the world By controlling our perceptions, the Stoics tell us we can find mental clarity - in directing our actions properly and justly, we will be effective The ares of great interest to the Stoics all make an appearance here: virtue, mortality, emotions, self-awareness, fortitude, right action, problem solving, acceptance, mental clarity, pragmatism, unbiased thought and duty January - Clarity 01/01: Control and choice</description>
