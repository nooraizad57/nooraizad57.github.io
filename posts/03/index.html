<ul>
<li>if we are the only one holding us accountable, likely we can procrastinate - we can move the goal post</li>
<li>working with coach, we are challenged to become better than who we are yesterday</li>
<li>the more we put ourselves out there, the more chances for a yes</li>
<li>to believe in a person before the person believe in themselves</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-does-someone-figure-out-what-they-want-actually">how does someone figure out what they want actually</h1>
<ul>
<li>if you have zero space, how can you focus on what matters most? - whatever you want to do in life, you simply don&rsquo;t have time to do that</li>
<li>you have to make some sacrifices for what you want. otherwise, the very thing you want, becomes what you sacrifice</li>
<li>once you got a vision that is compelling and exciting, you got the magnetic charges</li>
<li>many of us simply does not know what we want</li>
<li>instead of asking yourselves “what is my passion?” or “what is my purpose?” simply asked yourself: “what is i most curious about right now?”</li>
<li>asking yourself about your passion and purpose, is to put yourself in the future. but lets be honest, we cant predict the future. none of us if the future we want, will be manifest</li>
<li>bringing it to present and asking a softer question will ground you in the present, and allow you to focus on the wisdom that is inside us</li>
<li>whenever we begin a new path, we are not given the entire map upfront. the entire map open as we take steps forward - to more steps we take the more the map reveal</li>
<li>trust in the process, one step forward each day</li>
<li>there is an element in balance - you must have a vision to give you context for the day</li>
<li>its about taking small step - thinking big and starting small</li>
<li>focus on today - what small step that I can take to move forward - not to be overwhelmed with the progress, just keep on going</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-question-of-privileges-and-enjoyment">the question of privileges and enjoyment</h1>
<ul>
<li>there are two camp: firstly is the thing you want is actually the thing you really want - ask question: if the steps to get there is something that excites you</li>
<li>the second camp: you must still like the destination, but you don&rsquo;t like the process</li>
<li>ask yourself how to be more creative in the journey with the same thinking to achieve your aim</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="parting-thoughts">parting thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>we are all a miracle - the fact that we were born is the miracle itself</li>
<li>we have won the greatest lottery ever</li>
<li>the question: what are you going to do with the lottery you’ve won?</li>
</ul>
