<ul>
<li>Stoicism is often misunderstood</li>
<li>Definition of Stoicism: ancient philosophy that was once one of the most popular civic disciplines in the west</li>
<li>Contain some of the greatest wisdom in the history of the world - referring to Meditations by Marcus Aurelius: a series of private notes kept by the Roman Emperor</li>
<li>The objective of the book The Daily Stoic is to restore Stoicism to its rightful place as a tool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance and wisdom</li>
<li>The philosophy asserts that virtue (the four cardinal virtues of self-control, courage, justice and wisdom) is happiness, and it is our perceptions of things rather than the things themselves that cause most of our trouble</li>
<li>It teaches that we can’t control or rely on anything outside of our “reasoned choice” - our ability to choose how we categorise, respond and reorient ourselves to external events</li>
<li>Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca framed their work revolving Stoicism around a series of exercises in three critical disciplines:
<ul>
<li>The Discipline of Perception - how we see and perceive the world around us</li>
<li>The Discipline of Action - the decisions and actions we take and to what end</li>
<li>The Discipline of Will - how we deal with the things we cannot change, attain clear and convincing judgement and come to a true understanding of our place in the world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By controlling our perceptions, the Stoics tell us we can find mental clarity - in directing our actions properly and justly, we will be effective</li>
<li>The ares of great interest to the Stoics all make an appearance here: virtue, mortality, emotions, self-awareness, fortitude, right action, problem solving, acceptance, mental clarity, pragmatism, unbiased thought and duty</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="january---clarity">January - Clarity</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>01/01: Control and choice</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t</li>
<li>If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realise they are fighting an unwinnable battle</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>02/01: Education is freedom</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>reading and meditation on the wisdom of great minds is not to be done for its own sake. It has purpose</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>03/01: Be ruthless to the things that don’t matter</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>04/01: The big three</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Control your perceptions - direct your actions properly - willingly accept what is outside your control</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>05/01: Clarify your intentions</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it - no Stoic would tolerate that assumptions - but not having an end in mind is a guarantee you won’t</li>
<li>When your efforts are not directed at a cause or a purpose, how much will you know what do day in and day out? How will you know what to say no to and what to say yes to?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>06/01: Where, who, what, and why</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Have you taken the time to get clarity about who you are and what you stand for?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>07/01: Seven clear functions of the mind</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The proper work of the mind is the exercise of choice - to do and think right, refusal - of temptation, yearning - to be better, repulsion - of negativity of bad influences, of what isn’t true, preparation - for what lies ahead or whatever may happen, purpose - our guiding principle and highest priority and assent - to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside our control (and be ready to accept the latter).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>08/01 - Seeing our addictions</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Addiction is when we’ve lost the freedom to abstain</li>
<li>You must reclaim the ability to abstain because within it is your clarity and self-control</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>09/01 - What we control and what we dont</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An honest understanding of what is within our control provides real clarity about the world: all we have is our own mind</li>
<li>That it’s much better and more appropriately directed inward</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>10/01 - If you want to be steady</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It’s about filtering the outside world though the straightener of our judgement</li>
<li>If you want to be steady, if you want clarity, proper judgement is the best way</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>11/01 - If you want to be unsteady</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Epictetus is reminding you that serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgement, not your environment</li>
<li>Your problem will follow you wherever you run and hide</li>
<li>If you seek to avoid the harmful and disruptive judgements that cause those problems, then you will be stable and steady wherever you happen to be</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>12/01 - The one path to serenity</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Only thing you truly possess is your ability to make choices (and to use reason and judgement when doing so)</li>
<li>Sleep is a form of surrender and trust and how easily it comes</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>13/01 - Circle of control</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A wise person knows what’s inside their circle of control and what is outside of it</li>
<li>According to the Stoics, the circle of control contains just one thing: your mind</li>
<li>There is clarity in simplicity</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>14/01 - Cut the strings that pull your mind</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Every human being is pulled by these internal and external forces that are increasingly more powerful and harder to resist</li>
<li>As Viktor Frankl puts in The Will to Meaning: “Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>15/01 - Peace is in staying the course</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>State of mind produces tranquility</li>
<li>Tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in sticking to is: staying the course, making adjustments here and there, naturally but ignoring the distracting sirens who beckon us to turn toward the rocks</li>
</ul>
